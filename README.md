To start off, we have several sliders on the bottom right of the screen. This includes the starting angle slider, which sets the starting angle of the doll from the right side of the black surface. The starting angle can also be changed by clicking anywhere on the screen. 

Another slider is the center of mass slider, which changes the distance of the center of mass from the center of the semicircle. The maximum distance away from the center of the semicircle approaches the surface (50 away), and I recommend trying it out to see a very scared Jason. 

What we are calling the rolling friction slider is really a dampening variable. It is what helps the doll return to equilibrium. We then have the gravity slider, which changes the magnitude of the force of gravity (sorry that was obvious).

After you set the sliders to your desired starting position, there is a play button at the top left of the screen that will mobilize the doll. Subsequently, three graphs for the doll’s angle, velocity, and acceleration will show up on the bottom of the screen in place of the sliders. 

At any point, you can hit the reset button that will have replaced the play button on the top left of the screen to return to the stationary doll and sliders. 

There is an exit button on the top right off the screen that can close the window at any time. 

To reiterate the physics and how everything ties together, a roly poly doll consists of a mostly hollow body and a rounded bottom. A weight is placed on the bottom such that the center of mass is below the center of the bottom hemisphere. When the doll is set at an angle that is not upright, it will wobble back and forth, but not completely fall to the ground like other toys. This is because there is a positive distance between the center of mass and the center of the bottom hemisphere, changing the height of the center of mass as the doll wobbles and also the gravitational potential energy. 

To calculate the doll's movement at any point, we calculated the angular acceleration through the current state of the doll. From there we determined angular velocity and translation while assuming that we roll without slipping
